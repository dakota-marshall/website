A little late, but I wanted to make a quick little piece inspired by the eclipse I was lucky enough to see last week!

This is my first time seeing totality during an eclipse, and man it was breathtaking. I have honestly never seen
anything that's left me without words like that... I am going to take all the opportunities I can to see it again.

As for the render, this time I experimented with some plugins for the fog and the tree, they were pretty neat, and both
gave great results! It's not an overly complicated render, but I am happy with the vibe it's creating.
