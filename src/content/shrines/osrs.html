                    documenting my journey through OSRS. Its also still a WIP</p>

                <p>Runescape is an MMORPG that opened its doors all the way back in 2001, and as a kid I honestly never
                    played it. I grew up on other games and never found myself caught up in Runescape. It wasn't until
                    probably around 2019 that I decided to pick it up.</p>

                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>I remember around that time I was super into incremental games (aka idle games), and was looking for
                    something I could have open while I work. I had heard of Runescape, now re-released under what
                    everyone said was the "much better" OldSchool Runescape. People talked about how skilling in the
                    game can be very AFK, and so I thought I would give it a try. I tried OSRS first, but really quickly
                    fell off it. I personally couldn't get over how dated the graphics were. Everything was hard to
                    parse, and there really wasn't a lot of direction on what I should be doing after Tutorial Island so
                    I ultimately moved on. Then, in 2022, a YouTuber I ran across (who I will not be linking due to some
                    problematic behavior) made a series where they played RS3 (the original version of RuneScape that
                    kept updating), and it looked fascinating. They had a lot of quality of life improvements, the
                    graphics were updated, and there was a ton of content that wasnt in OSRS at the time, so I decided
                    to give it a go. Honestly, I played it for about a year, racking up a few hundred hours that were
                    mostly Woodcutting and Divination lol, but eventually the glaring issues started piling up. The
                    microtransactions being in my face were starting to get to me, it generally was a much more of a
                    "dead game". I barely ran into anyone chatty and the guilds I were in were often not super active.
                    Eventually, due to those issues and bordem, I stopped playing again. </p>

                <p>Around 2023 I started finding more of the OSRS content creators on YouTube, creators like
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Settledrs">Settled</a> with his Swampletics and Tileman series, or
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@J1mmy">J1mmy</a> with his By Release series of just his general
                    videos
                    talking about OSRS history and whatnot. They really started getting me in a mindset to give OSRS
                    another shot. I was working from home a lot at the time, so I decided to hop back on my account and
                    chop some wood. Lo and behold at time of writing I am level 1200 and about 400 hours into the game,
                    and I am having a blast!

                <h2>Why I Love Runescape</h2>

                <div style="float: right; padding: 10px;">
                    <figure style="margin: auto;">
                        <img src="/static/imgs/osrs/woodcutting.png" alt="my character" width="250"
                            style="border: thin var(--textcolor) solid;" />

                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>The sheer amount of content at varying levels of intensity make it, so I can either be chopping wood
                    while at work, or doing quests in the evening. It's unlike any other MMO I've ever played in that
                    regard. In OSRS the fear of missing out is entirely non-existent, so I never feel pressured to take
                    on
                    content in a rush. I can log in after not playing for a year and know that everything I planned on
                    doing
                    is still valid and available (looking at you Destiny 2...).</p>

                <p>I honestly really like the vibe of the game now too, I used to be a hater for the old graphics, but
                    they
                    are really growing on me, though I do use the 117HD plugin for better lighting. The community is
                    awesome
                    which is another big plus for the vibes. I am in the Bunny Burrow clan, a very LGBT clan and
                    everyone
                    there is super cool and has been incredibly nice to me.</p>

                <p>I love Woodcutting! Its definitely my favorite skill. I enjoy chopping some Magic Logs while I work
                    :D</p>
