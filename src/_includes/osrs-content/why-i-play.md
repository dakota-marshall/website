## Why I Love Runescape

The sheer amount of content at varying levels of intensity make it, so I can either be chopping wood while at work, or doing quests in the evening. It's unlike any other MMO I've ever played in that regard. In OSRS the fear of missing out is entirely non-existent, so I never feel pressured to take on content in a rush. I can log in after not playing for a year and know that everything I planned on doing is still valid and available (looking at you Destiny 2...). 

I honestly really like the vibe of the game now too, I used to be a hater for the old graphics, but they are really growing on me, though I do use the 117HD plugin for better lighting.  The community is awesome which is another big plus for the vibes. I am in the Bunny Burrow clan, a very LGBT clan and everyone there is super cool and has been incredibly nice to me.

I love Woodcutting! Its definitely my favorite skill. I enjoy chopping some Magic Logs while I work :D
