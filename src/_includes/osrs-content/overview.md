# Overview
The goal of this shrine is to serve less as an overview of what Runescape is, and more about documenting my journey through OSRS.

Runescape is an MMORPG that opened its doors all the way back in 2001, and as a kid I honestly never played it. I grew up on other games and never found myself caught up in Runescape. It wasn't until probably around 2019 that I decided to pick it up.
